#We put a condition in a job level.
#This job runs only if some other job failed
#We add failure() function to make sure that this job runs provided that any other jobs failed
#Technically, a failure() function returns true if any other jobs fails.
#We need to add needs context. Currently, it evaluates if any other jobs [lint, deploy] in front of that job has failed,
#We put in needs context only two jobs, because deploy jobs run only if build runs. There are dependencies
