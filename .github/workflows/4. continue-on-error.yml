#We remove if check on upload test report
#This workflow succeeded despite the a job test in a Test code step produce error 
#The overall workflow succeed. Continue-on-error treats a Test code step as a success depsite it technically failing
#We tell GitHub Action that even if we have an error we want to continue and treat this step as successful
#Other jobs executed
#If we want to the entire workflow to continue, even if that step fails - use continue-on-error
#If we want to run some selected steps or jobs and not the overall workflow - use if checks
#In comparison to if condition - it fails in a Test code step and then another jobs also failed
